description: "An in-progress novel that began out of an interest in Slavic mythologies and folklore, Earth and Smoke follows characters Ilyria and Wilk travelling through the fabled Zuriobor forest. An unlikely friendship is formed between the two as they find themselves exiled from the safe haven town Rasnov in the centre of the unforgiving forest region infested with monsters."
