description: Abstract
This article focuses on the video game Beckett by The Secret Experiment as an interactive piece of literature that displays features of Postmodernism using an existential approach. This approach is informed by Brian McHale’s work in Postmodernist Fiction, particularly his idea of the shift from Modernism to Postmodernism being signified by a shift in the dominant from epistemological to ontological. As well as this, I will be utilising ideas from Linda Hutcheon, such as the idea that Postmodernism is grounded in political and ideological values, and parody and imitation within this is also inherently political. The game draws inspiration from Samuel Beckett’s novel trilogy, which shows the dominant ontological shift itself. This is mirrored in the game, provoking existential questions of reality and the ‘self’ from players. Beckett also engages in a rejection of metanarratives as many other pieces of Postmodern literature do, while pushing the traditional boundaries of narrative with the player taking the place of the author or controlling entity in the game. The dystopian setting of the game utilises fantastical and realist elements, provoking abject feelings and questions of morality from the players. The game engages in academic theories, such as Freudian psychology theories such as ‘the reality principle,’ which was used ideologically to make reference to metal health, further situating the game within Postmodern literature and existential questioning.
